# orkl
Super simple peer-to-peer blogging site based on [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com).

## Why?
I wanted to build a peer-to-peer only blog; kind of like the p2p child of Svbtle and Telegra.ph. Fell in love with the idea of a site, which feels the same for the writer and the reader. The only difference is that the writer can change things and the reader can't. Thanks to [Dat](https://datproject.org/), we can easily decide if a computer is the owner or not of a site.

orkl is also 100% dynamic, so it's basically just a bunch of ```txt``` files (using [smarkt](https://github.com/jondashkyle/smarkt)) = no site generation or building.

## Usage
Coming soon.

## Development
```
npm install
npm start
```
To start watchify.

Thanks to [choo](https://choo.io), [Jon Kyle](https://jon-kyle.com) for Enoki and Dropout and the guys at Beaker.
