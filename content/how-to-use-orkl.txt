text: If you are reading this, then you've probably [forked the site](https://github.com/kodedninja/orkl#readme) successfully. This is a short guide on how to use orkl (it's really **not hard**).

If you haven't done it already, this is an important step. Open the ```dat.json``` file of your site and add the ```"fallback_page: "index.html"``` property to the JSON. This will tell Beaker to route every request to the ```index.html```.

Orkl is now ready to use.

### Writing a new entry
Navigate to the [homepage](/) of the site and click the "new entry" link at the top right corner.

Welcome to the super simple editor. You can enter a title, specify a date and write beautiful text. That's all. To style your text you can use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) a common [lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

### Modifying entries
If you navigate to one of the entries you can see that the at the top right corner there's an "edit" button. If you click on that it'll navigate you to the editor and you already know how to use that.

You can also delete an entry with the red "delete" button. Pretty obvious.

### Publishing
If you know how Beaker works you know that the changes you make are only visible to you. In order to make them public you have to "commit" or "publish". That's why there's a "publish" button in the top right corner, that's only visible if you have unpublished changes.

This way you can still save your progress, but they won't be visible to anyone else.


That's all. I said it won't be complicated. You can delete this entry if you want and access it anytime [here](dat://orkl-kodedninja.hashbase.io/how-to-use-orkl).
